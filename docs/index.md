## Pwoli

Pwoli is a Node JS framework written in TypeScript which can work independantly on a raw NodeJS/TypeScript environement OR, in co-ordination with other frameworks like Express.js.

Pwoli can connect to any kind of ORMs by implementing thier corresponding [ORM Adapters](/pwoli/api-docs/classes/ORMAdapter.html) and works with [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org) out of the box at present by [SequelizeAdapter](/pwoli/api-docs/classes/SequelizeAdapter.html).
