## Pwoli

Pwoli is a Node JS framework written in TypeScript which can work independantly on a raw NodeJS/TypeScript environement OR, in co-ordination with other frameworks like Express.js.

Pwoli can connect to any kind of ORMs by implementing thier corresponding [ORM Adapters](/pwoli/api-docs/classes/ORMAdapter.html) and works with [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org) out of the box at present by [SequelizeAdapter](/pwoli/api-docs/classes/SequelizeAdapter.html).

### Main Features

-   Fully flexible and extensible - thanks to the OOP based architecture.
-   Frontend widgets like ActiveForm, GridView, ListView for SSR applications.
-   [DataProviders](/pwoli/api-docs/classes/DataProvider.html) and [Serializers](/pwoli/api-docs/classes/Serializer.html) for the backends of SPA applications.
-   Works on both NodeJS and TypeScript applications.
-   Has reasonable defaults.
-   Well documented and [type](https://www.typescriptlang.org)d code for [IDE Intellisense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_code_completion).
